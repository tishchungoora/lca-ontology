# Life Cycle Assessment Ontology
This ontology describes the general methodology for conducting Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The ontology is formalized in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and is based on the documentation for ISO14040:2006 - the International Standard for LCA. In order to provide a basic backbone for the organisation of the ontology concepts, the Process Specification Language (ISO18629-1:2004) was consulted and the core classes object, activity, activity occurrence and timepoint are, therefore, defined in the LCA ontology.
